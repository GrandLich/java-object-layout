Java Object Layout Dumpers

                 This tool had migrated under OpenJDK:
           http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jol/

         (If you are the fork owner, please consider purging it,
            and cloning the OpenJDK-ish repository instead.
                 That will stop confusing the users.)
